"""Record the HTTP status the published report answers, at generation time.

The report says whether GitHub Pages is serving the site or answers 404, and
that claim is measured rather than assumed: this script requests the URL and
stores the status it answers with the measured numbers, so the page, the
README and ``results/audit.json`` quote one artifact.

    python scripts/check_pages.py

Run it when the report is regenerated, so the status stored beside the numbers
is the one the site answered at generation time.
